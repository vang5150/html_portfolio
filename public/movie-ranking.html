<h1>The Best Movies of All Time according to Vincent</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Casablanca</h3>
<p>A classic! Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman at their peak. Story about love, sacrifice, hope, resistance and a piano "so just remember this..." </p>
<h3>Star Wars "A New Hope"</h3>
<p> OG Star Wars, what hasn't already been said about this movie ? So many great film making elements and great story. Themes of hope, resistance and bravery in the face of overwhelming odds featuring now legendary characters and actors.</p>
<p>Interestingly the cantina scene is lifted straight from my other pick "Casablanca" and future character Jabba the Hutt was based on Signor Ferrari played by Sydney Greenstreet also from Casablanca </p>
<H3>The Blues Brothers</H3>
<p>Deadpan comedy set against a gritty Chicago back drop and great music with legendary artists like Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, John Lee Hooker and Chaka Khan to name a few.  Throw in one of the best car chases in movie history with police, a country and western band, neo nazis and you've got yourself something totally original, enjoyable and never to be replicated (the sequel was not good)</p>
